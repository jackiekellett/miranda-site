		<h2>Squeez-E-Mart</h2>
		<h3>February 2nd to 15th 2022</h3>
		<h4>embroidery floss, recycled bed sheet, heavy
			interfacing</h4>
		<p>This is the applique of sorts on the LSP dress I made, it was important that this
			aspect match the character design as much as possible so the whole piece would be recognizable.
			This took about two weeks of spare time. It's about 2.5 by 10 inches. I’m very glad I learned the
			importance of stabilizers before making this piece.</p>

		<h2>Hell</h2>
		<h3>July 2017</h3>
		<h4>black polyester thread, muslin</h4>
		<p>This took a few hours at most. I am a big fan of
			Branson Reese and at the time he did not have merchandise or prints of any kind for sale but I
			really love this panel from a comic of his so I replicated it in basic stitching. I like my use of
			cheap household thread in this, I think it reflects the linework of the illustration better than
			embroidery floss would have.</p>

		<h2>Arsenal</h2>
		<h3>December 2018</h3>
		<h4>embroidery floss, muslin</h4>
		<p>A friend of mine is a fan of the team and it
			was his birthday. There’s not a lot to do in my hometown. I learned to plan ahead when it came
			to directional stitches because this could have been much cleaner if I had done so.</p>

		<h2>Angry Cat</h2>
		<h3>January 2020</h3>
		<h4>embroidery floss, muslin</h4>
		<p>My sister sent me a tweet with an image of

			white background. My sister said “Make me this pls” I obliged.</p>
