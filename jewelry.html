		<h2>Gemini Necklace</h2>
		<h3>April 26th 2022</h3>
		<h4>simulated pearl beads, toggle closure, armature wire,
			metallic paint, paint marker, polymer clay, enamel paint, nail polish, clear top coat polish, jump
			rings, crimp tubes, clear flower beads, rhinestones, e6000 adhesive, beading wire</h4>
		<p>My sister (I
			know, she’s a recurring theme) sent me a Susan Alexandra necklace that was a bit out of my
			price range at the moment and requested it as her birthday gift. Big bet. I had acquired 17 cases
			of jewelry making supplies from my partner’s mother recently and my audacity came built in.
			The beading wire and findings were easy enough to get an approximation of done with the sheer
			amount of hand-me-down supplies. When it came to the Gemini nameplate I found polymer clay
			to fit the size better but was too weak to be anything but a display piece and that would not fly
			with my sister so I used black armature wire to shape the text and gold metallic markers for the
			correct color then sealed with clear nail polish. I made the charm from polymer clay, the metallic
			paint markers, nail polish and glued rhinestones that I had pried from a hello kitty belt buckle
			then I sealed it with clear nail polish. I mimicked the Susan Alexandra toggle clasp with more
			nail polish and my own initials as a fun bonus.</p>

		<h2>Stitch Markers</h2>
		<h3>February 27th 2020</h3>
		<h4>/ lever back earring findings, jump rings, pennies, nail
			polish, repurposed necklace with plastic beads</h4>
		<p>My mother is not like my sister, she rarely
			makes requests so when she asked for knitting stitch markers for mother’s day I was going to
			oblige with the limited materials in my studio apartment during the newborn pandemic. I drilled
			holes in pennies I cleaned with ketchup and added a sheer gold nail polish for more shine. I used
			nail polish to number and seal the coins as well, then I took apart a cheap necklace I had for
			years to get the bead accents and chain links to use as jump rings. Finally I attached them all to
			lever back earring findings.</p>

		<h2>Crab Earrings</h2>
		<h3>March 20th 2021</h3>
		<h4>Tamagogani dried crab snack, UV resin, jump rings, French
			hook earring findings</h4>
		<p>Tamagogani hits. I adored the aesthetics of the tiny little crabs and I
			wanted to keep them forever. I knew since they are dried they would hold up in UV resin casing
			where food with moisture would absolutely not I was still worried about the sugar but it’s been
			over a year and they are fine.</p>
